# Welcome to @nussucommit.com email account guide

This documentation will lead you on how to manage your @nussucommit.com email.

To begin with, make sure you know the username and the password of your email. If you don't have an account yet, you can contact the current Technical Manager to create one for you. If you forgot your email (or maybe the account has been created long time ago, and nobody know the password), you can also contact the current Technical Manager to reset the password for you.
