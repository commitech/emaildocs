# Logging in on a browser

The most easiest way (no set up required) to access your email is through a web browser. You can go to [http://webmail.nussucommit.com/](http://webmail.nussucommit.com/) and enter your email (with @nussucommit.com account, of course) and password. If you entered your email and password correctly, you will see three choices of webmail software (Horde, Roundcube, and SquirelMail). You can choose any one you want, and click logo of the one you want. After that, you should be redirected to your email page, which you can read/sent your email. 

You can try to click on the three different webmail softwares to see which matches your needs/preferences. If you have difficulty to log in, it means you have entered wrong password, or your account has not been set up yet. Contact the current Technical Manager for assistance (including if you want to reset your password).

This is an easy way to read/write your email. However, since @nussucommit.com email is quite important and you have to check it regularly, it seems annoying to have to login to this page everytime you have to check your email. The next few sections on this documentation will lead you on how to forward it to your personal email and how to send an email from your personal email, and how to set up @nussucommit.com email on your mobile phone/computer email client, so you will receive a push update (push notification) everytime you get an email.
