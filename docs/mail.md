# Setting up in mail client

It is hard to configure, but once you finished configure the email on your mail client, you will receive a push notification everytime you receive an email. Therefore, you don't have to check your email manually.

## iOS Mail settings

Go to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Add Account -> Other -> Add Mail Account.

You can use any name and description you want, but make sure the email and password is correct

Click Next after you fill those information, and on the top bar, choose IMAP (instead of POP). Fill the incoming mail server and outgoing mail server host name. Host name is `secure21.webhosting.hub`, username is `[your username]@nussucommit.com`, password is `[your password]`. Click Next, and you should be done.
