# Setting up in mail client

Other alternative to send/receive to/from your personal email address it to set the @nussucommit.com email address to your email client (whether it is in your phone, or your PC). It is quite hard to configure, but once you finished configure the email on your mail client, you will receive a push notification everytime you receive an email. Therefore, you don't have to check your email manually. You can also send an email from the email client.

## iOS Mail settings

Go to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Add Account -> Other -> Add Mail Account.

You can use any name and description you want, but make sure the email and password is correct

Click Next after you fill those information, and on the top bar, choose IMAP (instead of POP). Fill the incoming mail server and outgoing mail server host name. Host name is `secure21.webhosting.hub`, username is `[your username]@nussucommit.com`, password is `[your password]`. Click Next, and you should be done.
