# Forward to other email account

You can forward every email that comes to @nussucommit.com to your personal email, so you can check your @nussucommit.com email by checking your personal email. You will not need to login to webmail.nussucommit.com to check email anymore.

To do this, go to [webmail.nussucommit.com](webmail.nussucommit.com) and enter your @nussucommit.com email and password. Below the three email software options, there will be several menu buttons. Click the second button from the left that says "Forwarding Options".

To add an email address to be forwarded, click "Add Forwarder" button. In the "Forward to email address:", type the email address you want the email to be forwarded to. After that, click "Add Forwarder" button.

To remove a forwarded email address (for example, the forwarded email address is the email address belonged to the ex-commit member), click "Delete" on the "Functions" sidebar beside the email address.
