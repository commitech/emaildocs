# Sent email from other email account

You also can send every email from your personal email but the email will be sent on behalf of your @nussucommit.com email, so you do not have to login to webmail.nussucommit.com to send an email. This is different for each email service, so we will discuss for each one of them.

## Gmail

Login to [gmail.com](gmail.com). In the top-right corner, you should be able to see a gear button. Click the gear button and choose "Settings" from the drop-down list. On the top menu bar of the settings page, click "Accounts and Import". You will see several options, including "Send mail as:". Click "Add another email address you own" on the "Send mail as:" section. A pop-up will appear. There will be a form with two input box. Fill your name on the "Name" field, and fill your @nussucommit.com email address. Uncheck the "Treat as an alias" checkbox. Click "Next Step" button.

You will have another form, which is more complicated than the previous one. Don't panic, we will tell you what to fill for each input box. In the "SMTP Server" input box, enter `secure21.webhostinghub.com`. Choose `465` for the "Port" input dropdown list. In the "Username:" input box, enter `[your email]@nussucommit.com`. Don't forget to include the "@nussucommit.com" as well. In the "Password:" input box, enter your @nussucommit.com email password. In the radio option button below, choose "Secured connection using SSL" instead of "Secured connection using TLS", which is the recommended option. After you make sure all input fields are entered correctly, click "Add Account" button.

After that you need to verify that the email account is indeed yours. Of course, you can't send an email on behalf of another email address that is not yours. To do that, check your @nussucommit.com email account using webmail as explained in the [Logging in on a browser](browser.md) section. You should receive an email from Gmail consisting of a confirmation code. Enter that confirmation code in the verification page, and click "Verify". Congratulation, you should now be able to send email from gmail on behalf of your @nussucommit.com email.
